    <p>Semantic tags provide meaning to the structure of web pages and make it easier for search engines and screen readers to understand the content.
    it describes the meaning for the both browser and the developer. <br>

     <br>Examples of non-semantic elements: div and span - Tells nothing about its content.<br><br>
     div and span:<br>
     <b>div</b>:The div and span tags in HTML are used as containers to structure and style content. The div tag is a block-level element that groups multiple elements together, often used for layout purposes. It takes up the full width of its parent container and starts on a new line. Developers commonly use div along with CSS to create sections, apply styles, or control positioning on a webpage.<br><br>

    <b>span</b>:the span tag is an inline element used to style or manipulate a specific part of the text within a larger block of content. Unlike div, it does not break onto a new line and only affects the portion of text it surrounds. The span tag is useful for changing the color, font, or style of a few words inside a paragraph or sentence without affecting the entire block.
